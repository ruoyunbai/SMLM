# U-Net: Semantic segmentation with PyTorch


![input and output for a random image in the test dataset](https://i.imgur.com/GD8FcB7.png)


Customized implementation of the [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) in PyTorch for Kaggle's [Carvana Image Masking Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge) from high definition images.

This model was trained from scratch with 5000 images (no data augmentation) and scored a [dice coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) of 0.988423 (511 out of 735) on over 100k test images. This score could be improved with more training, data augmentation, fine tuning, playing with CRF post-processing, and applying more weights on the edges of the masks.



## Usage
**Note : Use Python 3.6 or newer**

### Docker

A docker image containing the code and the dependencies is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/milesial/unet).
You can jump in the container with ([docker >=19.03](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)):

```shell script
docker run -it --rm --gpus all milesial/unet
```



### Training

```shell script
> python train.py -h
usage: train.py [-h] [--epochs E] [--batch-size B] [--learning-rate LR]
                [--load LOAD] [--scale SCALE] [--validation VAL] [--amp]

Train the UNet on images and target masks

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --epochs E, -e E      Number of epochs
  --batch-size B, -b B  Batch size
  --learning-rate LR, -l LR
                        Learning rate
  --load LOAD, -f LOAD  Load model from a .pth file
  --scale SCALE, -s SCALE
                        Downscaling factor of the images
  --validation VAL, -v VAL
                        Percent of the data that is used as validation (0-100)
  --amp                 Use mixed precision
```

By default, the `scale` is 0.5, so if you wish to obtain better results (but use more memory), set it to 1.
The input images and target masks should be in the `data/imgs` and `data/masks` folders respectively. For Carvana, images are RGB and masks are black and white.

### Prediction

After training your model and saving it to `MODEL.pth`, you can easily test the output masks on your images via the CLI.

To predict a single image and save it:

`python predict.py -i image.jpg -o output.jpg`

To predict a multiple images and show them without saving them:

`python predict.py -i image1.jpg image2.jpg --viz --no-save`

```shell script
> python predict.py -h
usage: predict.py [-h] [--model FILE] --input INPUT [INPUT ...] 
                  [--output INPUT [INPUT ...]] [--viz] [--no-save]
                  [--mask-threshold MASK_THRESHOLD] [--scale SCALE]

Predict masks from input images

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --model FILE, -m FILE
                        Specify the file in which the model is stored
  --input INPUT [INPUT ...], -i INPUT [INPUT ...]
                        Filenames of input images
  --output INPUT [INPUT ...], -o INPUT [INPUT ...]
                        Filenames of output images
  --viz, -v             Visualize the images as they are processed
  --no-save, -n         Do not save the output masks
  --mask-threshold MASK_THRESHOLD, -t MASK_THRESHOLD
                        Minimum probability value to consider a mask pixel white
  --scale SCALE, -s SCALE
                        Scale factor for the input images
```
You can specify which model file to use with `--model MODEL.pth`.

### Weights & Biases

The training progress can be visualized in real-time using [Weights & Biases](wandb.ai/).  Loss curves, validation curves, weights and gradient histograms, as well as predicted masks are logged to the platform.

When launching a training, a link will be printed in the console. Click on it to go to your dashboard. If you have an existing W&B account, you can link it
 by setting the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable.


### Pretrained model
A [pretrained model](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet/releases/tag/v1.0) is available for the Carvana dataset. It can also be loaded from torch.hub:

```python
net = torch.hub.load('milesial/Pytorch-UNet', 'unet_carvana')
```
The training was done with a 100% scale and bilinear upsampling.

## Data
The Carvana data is available on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/data).

You can also download it using your Kaggle API key with:

```shell script
bash download_data.sh <username> <apikey>
```

## Notes on memory

The model has be trained from scratch on a GTX970M 3GB.
Predicting images of 1918*1280 takes 1.5GB of memory.
Training takes much approximately 3GB, so if you are a few MB shy of memory, consider turning off all graphical displays.
This assumes you use bilinear up-sampling, and not transposed convolution in the model.

## Convergence

See a reference training run with the Caravana dataset on [TensorBoard.dev](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/1m1Ql50MSJixCbG1m9EcDQ/#scalars&_smoothingWeight=0.6) (only scalars are shown currently).
